**Hi, I'm Emily! ðŸ‘‹**

I am currently a graduate student in the [Biggs Watershed Science Lab](https://biggslab.sdsu.edu/) at San Diego State University. Currently, I am studying the use of recurrent neural networks to predict streamflow and to better understand changing hydrological systems.

I am also involved in a water quality monitoring project where we are working on tracking microbial contamination in San Diego River and the Tijuana River Estuary. For more information on this project, check out the [real-time water quality project website](https://biggslab.sdsu.edu/?page_id=473).

If you're interested in creative solutions to visualizing hydrology data, check out my [explore-hydrology-p5js](https://github.com/EmilyDeardorff/explore-hydrology-p5js) repository.
