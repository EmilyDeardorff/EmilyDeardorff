**Hi, I'm Emily! ðŸ‘‹**

I am a water resources data scientist working with the [NOAA Office of Water Prediction](https://water.noaa.gov/) to improve large-scale flood inundation maps.  

My research background is focused on studying the use of [recurrent neural networks to predict streamflow](https://www.proquest.com/openview/4fdb4c5612e9385230c65e5c9e8cdb6e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) and [improving methods of detecting microbial contamination in San Diego River](https://biggslab.sdsu.edu/?page_id=473).

If you're interested in creative solutions to visualizing hydrology data, check out my [explore-hydrology-p5js](https://github.com/EmilyDeardorff/explore-hydrology-p5js) repository.
